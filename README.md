# Angular Introspection

GraphQL has a powerful introspection engine. What if we could leverage it during the creation of user interfaces, to support binding data from GraphQL to components?

This repository is a long way from being that, but it does try and play around with query introspection.

TODO - add a gif showing how it works.
